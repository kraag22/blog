For converting we will use tool `calibre`. Install it on mac via

```
brew install calibre
```

Then you can use `ebook-convert` CLI to do the work. For example to convert epub format to pdf.

```
ebook-convert book.epub book.pdf
```

And PDF you can send to Kindle via `Send to Kindle` mac application.
